# Task IV: AI for Venture Capital - Prediction of Startup Success

**Description**
This task tests the ability of Large Language Models to act as Venture Capitalists by predicting the potential success of early-stage startups. Using the **VCBench** dataset, which consists of anonymized founder profiles, participants must predict whether a startup will achieve a significant liquidity event (IPO, M&A >$500M, or high-tier funding).

**Goal & Constraints**
*   **Objective:** Predict the binary "Success" label for given founder profiles.
*   **Optimization:** Participants are encouraged to optimize input templates and output extraction methods alongside model fine-tuning.
*   **Metric:** F1-Score.

**Datasets**

*   **VCBench**: A benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital with 9,000 anonymized founder profiles.
